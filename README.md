# OpenGL-simulation-ship-and-changing-time-of-day
- This project is an interactive computer graphics simulation built using OpenGL that showcases a moving ship transitioning through different times of the day. The program enables users to interactively control the ship's movement, simulate environmental changes like day-to-night transitions, and even shoot rockets. The project demonstrates fundamental OpenGL concepts, including object rendering, lighting, and shading.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Real-Time Ship Animation** – Smooth sailing simulation using OpenGL
- **Dynamic Day-Night Cycle** – Transitions between morning, afternoon, evening, night, and midnight
- **Interactive Controls** – Move the ship forward/backward and switch between time periods
- **Rocket Firing Effect** – Press a key to launch a rocket into the sky
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Lightweight & Efficient** – Optimized using OpenGL + GLUT

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language** : C++
- **Graphics Library** : OpenGL, GLUT
- **Development Tools** : Visual Studio Code, GCC, MinGW
- **OS Compatibility** : Windows, Linux, macOS

## 🎨 Simulation Stages
- **Morning** : Warm orange hues with soft sunlight.
- **Afternoon** : Bright blue skies with sharp, clear shadows.
- **Evening** : Shades of red and purple bathe the ship in golden light.
- **Night** : A starry sky illuminated by the moon reflects on the calm water.

## 🎮 How to Play?

| 🎯 **Action**                | ⌨️ **Key Press** |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| ▶️ **Start Simulation**       | `Enter`        |
| ⏩ **Move Ship Forward**       | `6`            |
| ⏪ **Move Ship Backward**      | `4`            |
| 🌅 **Change to Early Morning** | `y`            |
| ☀️ **Change to Morning**       | `m`            |
| 🌇 **Change to Afternoon**     | `a`            |
| 🌆 **Change to Evening**       | `e`            |
| 🌙 **Change to Night**         | `n`            |
| 🌑 **Change to Midnight**      | `d`            |
| 🚀 **Fire Rocket**            | `z`            |
| ❌ **Exit the Program**        | `Esc`          |


## 🎯 How It Works?

1️⃣ **Start the Simulation** – The ship starts moving as the environment transitions dynamically  
2️⃣ **Control Ship Movement** – Use arrow keys (`6` for forward, `4` for backward)  
3️⃣ **Change Time of Day** – Modify lighting and background with single-key commands  
4️⃣ **Fire Rocket** – Press `z` to launch a **firework effect** 🚀  
5️⃣ **Exit the Program** – Press `Esc` to quit ❌
